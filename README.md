# 💡 PowerCo Churn Analysis – A BCG X Data Science Simulation

## Overview

This project is part of a virtual experience program simulating real-world work as a Data Scientist at **BCG X**. The task involves investigating the factors contributing to customer churn for PowerCo, a major energy provider, with a special focus on **price sensitivity**.

Through data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, we aim to determine whether price fluctuations—particularly off-peak energy prices—are a strong predictor of churn, and to deliver actionable insights to the business.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

**How does price sensitivity influence churn?**  
The business wants to understand whether customers who experience higher variability in pricing—especially off-peak prices between December and January—are more likely to churn. We built a pipeline to explore, model, and explain this relationship.

## ✅ Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Analyzed customer and price datasets  
   - Performed descriptive statistics and visualizations  
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created features representing price variation across months  
   - Included specific feature: *December–January off-peak price delta*  
3. **Modeling**  
   - Used a **Random Forest classifier** to predict churn  
   - Evaluated model performance and feature importance  
4. **Business Impact**  
   - Found that price variation is a top churn driver  
   - Proposed targeted pricing strategies to reduce churn risk
